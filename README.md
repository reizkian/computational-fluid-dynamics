# Finite Difference Fluid Flow Simulation on Two Dimensional Bodies 

Quick overview of the code can be oppened at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jjYIPgRl4ipRyhntGpk8KwNoPDut_tQ_#scrollTo=RIu-1Je1Hcux).

Full report of the simulation [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AqIJIaqwMp2GYsDtIiSv4M4S1EKE-b_L/view?usp=sharing).

The numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation has been succeeding acquired by finite difference method. The discussion in this simulation involving: how fluid particle movement affect each other, and how the fluid interacts with the geometry of an object and the wall of a channel. There are a consistent physical phenomenon that can be observed such as: Pressure diffusion,Fluid particles compression and Fluid particles dragging effect near the object,finally increases velocity due to the consequence of continuity equation.
